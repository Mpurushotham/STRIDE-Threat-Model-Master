## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Components

| Component | Trust Level | Description | Security Controls |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Car TCU** | 🔒 High | Telematics Control Unit in vehicle | Secure Boot, HSM, Firmware Signing |
| **Cellular Network** | 🚫 None | Public 4G/5G infrastructure | TLS 1.3, Network Segmentation |
| **IoT Gateway** | 🟡 Medium | Cloud message broker | mTLS, API Gateway, WAF |
| **Telemetry DB** | 🔒 High | Time-series database | Encryption at Rest, RBAC, Backup |

### Trust Boundaries

- **🚗 Vehicle Trust Zone** - High trust, physical access required
- **🌐 Public Network** - Zero trust, untrusted infrastructure  
- **☁️ Cloud Trust Zone** - Managed trust, validated inputs only
